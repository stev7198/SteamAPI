# Contributing to SteamAPI

We appreciate your interest in contributing to the **SteamAPI** project! Whether you want to fix a bug, improve documentation, or add a new feature, we're happy to have you involved. This guide will help you get started.

## How to Contribute

### 1. **Create a Branch**

Next, create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your work separate from the main branch (`main`) and helps in keeping the project organized.

In your terminal or Git GUI, run:

`git checkout -b my-feature-branch`

Make sure to give your branch a descriptive name that relates to the feature or bug you're working on (e.g., `fix-login-bug` or `add-new-api-method`).

### 2. **Make Your Changes**

Now, you can make changes to the codebase. Whether you're adding a new feature, fixing a bug, or updating documentation, ensure your changes are well-documented, easy to understand, and follow existing coding styles.

### 3. **Test Your Changes**

Before you commit your changes, be sure to test them thoroughly to ensure they work as expected.

-   Run the existing tests to confirm nothing else has been broken.

-   Add any new tests if you've added new functionality.

### 4. **Commit Your Changes**

Once you're happy with your changes, commit them to your branch with a descriptive message. A good commit message should briefly describe what was changed and why.

Example:

`git add .`

`git commit -m "Fix bug with Steam API token handling"`

### 6. **Push to Your Branch**

Push your changes back to your forked repository on GitHub:

`git push origin my-feature-branch`

### 7. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**

Once your changes are pushed to your fork, you can open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes into the main repository. To do this:

-   Go to the main repository.

-   Click on "Pull Requests" in the top menu.

-   Click "New Pull Request" and select your feature branch from your fork.

-   Add a descriptive title and explanation of your changes.

-   Click "Create Pull Request."

### 8. **PR Review and Feedback**

Once you submit your pull request, the project maintainers will review your code. They may request changes or give feedback. Be open to suggestions and make adjustments as needed.

Once your pull request is approved, it will be merged into the main repository.
