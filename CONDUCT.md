# Code of Conduct for the SteamAPI Project

We welcome and encourage participation in the **SteamAPI** project by everyone. To ensure that the project remains a friendly and productive space for all, we ask that contributors follow the guidelines below.

## Our Pledge

We, as members of the **SteamAPI** community, pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all, and we will not tolerate any form of discrimination, harassment, or inappropriate behavior.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language

-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences

-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism

-   Focusing on what is best for the community

-   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery, and unwelcome sexual attention or advances

-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

-   Public or private harassment

-   Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their consent

-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting one of the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to GitHub repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, code reviews, and any other communication channels related to the project.

It also applies when an individual is representing the project in public spaces (e.g., conferences, social media, etc.), where the individual is clearly identified as a participant in the **SteamAPI** community.
