\title{steamR: An R Package for the Steam API Using httr2}
\description{
The **steamR** package wraps key Steam Web API endpoints using httr2. It provides R functions to retrieve
user summaries, friend lists, owned games, game news, and global achievement statistics.
Each function performs the minimum wrangling necessary so that data is returned as a data frame or list.
}
\details{
This package requires a valid Steam API key to access the endpoints. It is cross-platform (Windows, Mac, and Linux).
All functions handle HTTP errors gracefully using httr2â€™s built-in retry and error handling. For more details on how
to use httr2, see its documentation.
}
\section{Future Plans}{

\itemize{
  \item Expand support to include additional endpoints (e.g., Steam Store API for pricing and discount data).
  \item Implement caching and more sophisticated error logging.
  \item Develop interactive dashboards for data visualization.
}
}
